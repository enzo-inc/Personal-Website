  Hi there, I'm Enzo. I am a software engineer with a background in artificial intelligence and distributed systems.

  I completed my BSc from the University of Edinburgh in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering in 2022, followed by a MSc in Financial Technology from the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies in 2023.
  
  Since then, I have taken part in the Entrepreneur First graduate cohort in London, where I focused on finding a cofounder and bringing a start-up to life in an high-agency environment. While the journey at Entrepreneur First did not end in a successful venture, I am still working in the entrepreneurship space.

  So if you are interested in building world-changing products and are looking for a strong technical cofounder, feel free to reach out.

  I am currently interested in exploring how LLMs can be embedded in everyday digital tasks to reduce friction points and improve human-computer interactions. I believe LLMs will radically change the way we think about the concept of 'work' and enable us to focus on ever-higher levels of abstraction, creativity and innovation.`;
